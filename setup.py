"""setup.py shim

This setup.py is needed to work arround this error:
'
ERROR: File "setup.py" not found. Directory cannot be installed in editable
mode: /path/to/project/root/directory (A "pyproject.toml" file was found,
but editable mode currently requires a setup.py based build.)
'
This is due to a limitation in Setuptools support for PEP 660.
This shim delegates the job of doing an editable install to Setuptoolsâ€™ legacy
mechanism until native support for PEP 660 is available.
